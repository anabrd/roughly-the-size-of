# ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF

Roughly The Size Of is a project created to facilitate country-to-US-state comparison, both by land area and population.


## HOW IT WORKS

Roughly The Size of is a web application that allows users to select any country of the world from a drop-down menu,
then opt whether they would like to compare that country by its size (land area) or population.

They are then redirected to the results page, where the output is a US state (or combination thereof) whose size or population roughly corresponds to that of the selected country.

Upon performing the search, the user is presented with the option of doing another comparison or viewing their search history.

The search history page provides an overview of past queries and their results, from which users can choose to return to the home page or perform another search.

The website also contains an “about” page with brief description of the project and the inspiration behind it.
